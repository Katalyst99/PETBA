# PETBA
* Personal Expenses Tracker with Budget Allocation

## Description:
PETBA - An application that helps users with:
* Recording daily, weekly, or Monthly expenses and income
* Grouping/categorizing expenditures such as, food, entertainment or investments.
* Setting and monitoring budgets to receive alerts when or if they spend more than the allocated budget.
* Visualization of spending trends with graphs such as, pie charts or bar graphs

## Reasons For Development:
* `Financial Focus:` Since finance is a field of interest for many and in particular personal finance. I believe PETBA can and will be the solution for many users struggling with their financials.
* `Dynamic:` PETBA has a mix of both backend logic(storing and analyzing data) and frontend interaction (visualizing trends).
* `Understandability:` I can build it brick by brick using most of the technologies/tools I am already familiar with for both backend and frontend.

## Learning Objectives:
By successfully developing PETBA, I will learn and gain knowledge on how to manage and display financial data.
`Specifically:`
* `Backend:` API development, database integration and authentication.
* `Frontend:` Dynamic and responsive design, data visualization using Chart.js
* `Testing and deployment:` Ensure the application functions correctly and handles edge cases.

## Technologies:
1. `Backend: Python with Django`
2. `Database: PostgreSQL`
3. `Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript`
4. `Third service: Alpha Vantage and Plaid API`
